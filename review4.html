            The first part of the book is divided into two stories. The first story is one of those stories that you see in cheesy romantic movies. A beautiful love story, set in New York with gorgeous characters that kiss under clouds of sugar. Or so it seems. Because the characters hide a darker side. The second story is a mystery story of a man that lost his wife and he is accused for her murder. But then right in the middle of the book a wicked twist changes everything. The story transforms to Flynn’s regular stories that are dark, twist-full and gory.

            The first part of the book had me hooked to the story. The mystery had me guessing and the love story made me to want to find out more. But it is the second part that made me not to able to stop reading! This book is full of twists. Twists that hit you like asteroids and keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The twists and turns are so many and so unexpected that you just cannot predict what will happen next!

            But where Flynn does the best work is in the characters. Characters amazingly developed. This is the main aspect that makes her story so good. Her ability to create multidimensional characters. A good mystery really lies upon characters and Flynn’s can really carry a story that surprises you constantly. The story is unfold between two point of view. This choice is what makes the book so great. Seeing the story through the eyes of two characters keeps guessing!

            Every single detail is important and it turns the reader towards another direction. The ending of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn was so unexpected. There are people who love it and those who hate it. Two pages before the book ends Flynn throws a huge twist that you either hate or love. Personally I loved it. I don’t think that there could be a more fitting ending. It is one of those books that you finish and you can’t stop thinking about.

            Gillian Flynn is an ingenious, spectacular author. Reading her books feels like falling down into a dark rabbit hole. Mystery, twists, lies, secrets, revelations and the most important of all nasty characters.
