            Chetan Bhagat, who is known for his romance genre novels, has tried his hand at a murder mystery and it will grip you instantly. This 300-page murder thriller revolves around an IIT pass out guy named Keshav and his ex-girlfriend Zara. Things seemed pretty much centred on this heartbroken guy’s sad life and obsessive love in the beginning. He drowns himself in alcohol, drunk dials, and stalks his ex on social media, unable to move on even after 4 years of separation and her ignoring him. Then one day, he gets a message from Zara on her birthday, and that changes everything.

            We jump into a murder plot and that’s when the story get’s interesting. Keshav and his funny yet witty best friend Saurav’s journey to find the culprit is the best part of this novel. The protagonist stands by his belief despite of his background, upbringing and environment he’s put in. The book keeps you guessing who is the culprit till the very end, and it is a good roller-coaster ride with its decent plot twists. The book also addresses the stereotypes and political issues we face in India. Surely a Bollywood movie based on this can be expected in the pipeline!

            Overall, it’s a simple narrative with easy language usage, and a onetime read.
