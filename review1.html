            In my opinion the author did a really great job with the three character’s voices. All three of them felt unique and like me you will experience so, so many feelings reading their story. While they were interesting, I can’t say I liked any of them. But it was ok. I don’t expect to like all the characters I read about and here the reader is not meant to like them. All of them are flawed, all of them have insecurities and fears and because of that all of them felt real and in some way even relatable.

            I found ‘The Girl on the Train’ to be a quintessential psychological thriller. By that I mean the vast majority of the story is told from the minds of 3 characters. This was risky business as at least 2 of them, Megan and Anna, are unlikable. Many probably dislike the third character, Rachel, who is the main protagonist, as well. The author Paula Hawkins made it work, however, as she did a terrific job with character development. By understanding why they did what they did, I found I was able to overlook the basic unsavoriness of these 3 women and connect with them all.
            
            Another thing I really liked was the edginess of the read. From early on the atmosphere was eerily foreboding. You just knew something bad was going to happen, but you didn’t know what and you didn’t know when. The author took her time with the story, slowly building up the tension, giving the reader bits and pieces of info along the way. Some readers may feel impatient with this, but I loved the mood and the slower pace.
            
            The protagonist was on the train A LOT. This could be off putting to some, but to me, the train was simply another character and I liked the “flavor” it brought to the story.
            
            One feature I wasn’t terribly fond of was the switching back and forth of time frames. Initially, this was confusing to me, but once I started to really pay attention to the chapter headings, I could better follow it.
            
            If you’re a fan of dark books with flawed characters, I suggest giving this a go. But don’t bring your high expectations with you, because high expectations might ruin this book for you.
