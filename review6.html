            The Time Machine seems to compare favorably with mainstream literature of its day. When compared with more modern novels, science fiction or otherwise, parts of it seem a bit quaint and stuffy. Still, Wells was a good writer and the novel has a sense of wonder; it’s a fine adventure tale.

            On the surface, the circumstances and science sound good, but they don’t hold up well if you know much about science. I accept the idea of the time machine, since that particular fantasy is central to the story, but there are a few other details that bothered me.

            First, the Time Traveller describes the land as being devoid of fungi. The primary decomposers in an ecosystem are fungi; without them, you can’t have a gorgeous landscape. I guess Wells just didn’t want stinkhorns on his world.

            Also, the Eloi are described as being disease-free. Perhaps science could get rid of parasites and viruses. But you can’t kill off the bacteria; otherwise, the whole ecosystem goes down. No decomposition, no nitrogen fixation, no plants … no Eloi. Since there must be bacteria, eventually you’ll have disease, since bacteria mutate quickly and will occupy any ecological niche that they can get started in.

            The behavior of the Morlocks rang a little false with me. They’re intelligent enough to run the machines and lay a trap. Why didn’t they use weapons while trying to hunt the Time Traveler down? Chimpanzees and even crows use primitive tools. I suppose Wells kept the Morlocks unarmed so that the hero could get away; a party of armed Morlocks could have easily brained him.

            Also, I didn’t completely believe the development of the Morlock society. I don’t think a working class, no matter how subjugated, could be kept down for so long. It only takes one extremely able person to get a revolution going, and in the time frame the novel spans I’m sure that the workers would have already rebelled successfully.

            I think Wells was accurate in showing the evolutionary changes that could occur in several hundred thousand years’ time. The physical changes to the Eloi were pretty good; I have read other predictions that humans will get more androgynous and possibly smaller if automation progresses at its current pace.

            However, I doubt the extent of their mental deterioration. I think that they would have had games and sports, and that would have almost guaranteed that at least some of the Eloi would not have been so small and weak. Humans love games; even in places where there is no literacy and no ambition, you have stickball and basketball and poker. The Eloi still had language, why not at least some balls to throw around?

            My criticisms aside, I thought the novel has held up very well. Some of Wells’ scientific reasoning was off, but the knowledge of the day was limited. The story is good and fast-paced, and the descriptions are engaging. The novel lacks the literary ammunition of other works of the same period, but it paved the way for a whole lot of really excellent science fiction stories and novels.
